# Example Output
# Your final bill is: $28.
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:
#
#
#
# Hint Think about what you've learnt about multiple if statements and see if you can reduce the number of lines of
# code while having the same functionality. Test Your Code Check your code is doing what it is supposed to. When
# you're happy with your code, click submit to check your solution.

extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese? Y or N ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
