# Instructions

# Heads or Tails
# You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".
#
# Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.
#
# There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random
# number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.
#
# e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails
#
# Example Output
# Heads
# or
#
# Tails
# When you're happy with your code, click submit.
#
# Testing Your Code Check your code is doing what it is supposed to. When you're happy with your code, click submit
# to check your solution. Your program may look like it is failing the tests when it isn't. We're using the random
# functionality in this exercise, so the tests will match different outcomes.

# Remember to use the random module
# Hint: Remember to import the random module here at the top of the file. ðŸŽ²

# Write the rest of your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

import random

random_number = random.randint(0, 1)

if random_number == 1:
    print("Heads")
else:
    print("Tails")
